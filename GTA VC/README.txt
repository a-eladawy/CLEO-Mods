--- Description of each mod ---
Hmm Nice Bike: Makes Tommy say "Hmm Nice Bike" whenever a bike spawns nearby, with a 2 minutes cooldown.
Reinforcements in Hit the Courier: Spawns Vercetti Gang Members to ambush the deal in the Hit the Courier mission (they can spawn during any mission if you go to the deal's location).
Reinforcements in Keep your Friends Close: Spawns Vercitti gang members accross the mansion in the final mission (recommended to be installed after Rub Out).
- The reinforcement mods auto-despawns the gang members when you go away from them to clear game memory.

Hmm Nice Bike was inspired by Modstar's New Vice City 2007 mod where Tommy can talk using mission audio outside missions on certain conditions.
Reinforcements mods were inspired by Razor Vermillion's bodyguard mod: https://www.gtainside.com/en/vicecity/mods/112306-vice-city-bodyguards/
